Hi! I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student at the Computer Science Department at University of Maryland College Park, advised 
by [Prof. Heng Huang](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~heng/). Previously, I was a Ph.D. student at ECE Department at University
of Pittsburgh before our group moving to UMD.

My research interests are generative modeling and making deep neural networks efficient and deployable in real-world
applications. I am also interested in automated medical image analysis.

I spent Summer 2023 as a research scientist intern at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/), Seattle, where I 
worked on architectural efficiency of diffusion models and was fortunate to have 
[Yan Kang](https://research.adobe.com/person/yan-kang/), [Yuchen Liu](https://lychenyoko.github.io/), 
[Richard Zhang](https://richzhang.github.io/), and [Zhe Lin](https://research.adobe.com/person/zhe-lin/) 
as my mentors. I was also a Deep Learning Intern at [Enlitic](https://enlitic.com/) in Summer 2021.

I got my Bachelor of Science (B.Sc) from University of Tehran, working with [Dr. Reshad Hosseini](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~reshad.hosseini) on 3D Reconstruction of Symmetric Structures where I was a member of [Computational Audio-Vision Lab](https://visionlab.ut.ac.ir/index.html).
