Hi! I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student at the Computer Science Department at University of Maryland College Park, advised 
by [Prof. Heng Huang](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~heng/). Previously, I was a Ph.D. student at ECE Department at University
of Pittsburgh before our group moving to UMD.

My research interests are generative modeling and making deep neural networks efficient and deployable in real-world
applications. I am also interested in automated medical image analysis.

I spent Summer 2023 as a research scientist intern at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/), Seattle, where I 
worked on architectural efficiency of diffusion models and was fortunate to have 
[Yan Kang](https://research.adobe.com/person/yan-kang/), [Yuchen Liu](https://lychenyoko.github.io/), 
[Richard Zhang](https://richzhang.github.io/), and [Zhe Lin](https://research.adobe.com/person/zhe-lin/) 
as my mentors. I was also a Deep Learning Intern at [Enlitic](https://enlitic.com/) in Summer 2021.

I got my Bachelor of Science (B.Sc) from University of Tehran, working with [Dr. Reshad Hosseini](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~reshad.hosseini) on 3D Reconstruction of Symmetric Structures where I was a member of [Computational Audio-Vision Lab](https://visionlab.ut.ac.ir/index.html).

Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
